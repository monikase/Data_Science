## K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier - the Random Dataset

This project demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple yet powerful classification method, on a synthetically generated dataset. The primary goal is to build and optimize a model that can accurately classify data points into one of three distinct classes. By visualizing the data and systematically tuning the model's parameters, this project provides a clear and practical guide to implementing the KNN classifier and evaluating its performance.
