# Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier - YouTube Dataset

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to automatically classify YouTube comments as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). Using a dataset of YouTube comments, the goal is to train a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification tasks. The model learns to distinguish between spam and legitimate comments based on the words they contain, providing a practical solution to filter unwanted content.
